"People can collect more than enough data in the Internet era. However, it is "

"An aggregate query groups search results by specified column values and then "
"counts the number of records in each group. For example, an aggregate query "
"in which a location column is specified counts the number of records per "

"date column is an easy way to visualize changes over time. Also, a "
"combination of refinement by location and an aggregate query against a date "
"column allows visualization of changes over time in specific location. Thus "
"refinement and aggregation are important to perform data mining."

msgid ""
"An inverted index is a traditional data structure used for large-scale full "
"text search. A search engine based on inverted index extracts index terms "
"from a document when it is added. Then in retrieval, a query is divided into "
"index terms to find documents containing those index terms. In this way, "
"index terms play an important role in full text search and thus the way of "
"extracting index terms is a key to a better search engine."

"A tokenizer is a module to extract index terms. A Japanese full text search "
"engine commonly uses a word-based tokenizer (hereafter referred to as a word "
"tokenizer) and/or a character-based n-gram tokenizer (hereafter referred to "
"as an n-gram tokenizer). A word tokenizer-based search engine is superior in "
"time, space and precision, which is the fraction of relevant documents in a "
"search result. On the other hand, an n-gram tokenizer-based search engine is "
"superior in recall, which is the fraction of retrieved documents in the "
"perfect search result. The best choice depends on the application in "
"practice."

"Groonga supports both word and n-gram tokenizers. The simplest built-in "
